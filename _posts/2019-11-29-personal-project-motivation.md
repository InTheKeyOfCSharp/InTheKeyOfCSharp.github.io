Just like how I struggled with getting this first blog post written, I'm struggling to find something meaningful to work on.

A little background - I went to college and studied cybersecurity because I felt that that was my way to make an impact in the world. I wanted to be the one to catch the bad guys, wear the white hat. As I went through college, however, I found that I had a passion for developing a lot more than I did attacking or defending. Most of my jobs reflected this, whether it be tutoring beginning programming concepts or building basic web applications at my first internship, I enjoyed doing that. I felt satisfied in the same way that a baker feels making a new recipe or that a guitarist feels being able to shred a new solo.

While going through my undergrad, I did whatever I could to stay on top of new technology. I bought courses for myself on Udemy, subscribed to all the newsletters, read the latest blogs, listened to podcasts with founders of modern programming practices. Anything and everything I could get my hands on I did. And I learned a lot. I also became incredibly overwhelmed. Overwhemled at the vast array of topics and the sub-topics within those topics.

Let's use Javascript as an example. When I started diving deeper into Javascript, I found that I could focus on web development using frameworks such as Angular, React, Vue, etc. I could also get into backend development with Node and it's variety of server frameworks for backend development. Oh, but now we need to persist that data, so we need to learn SQL and choose from 6 different database providers. But wait, shouldn't we have an ORM in order to make it easier to deal with the data? But then at that point, MongoDB or Firebase has come around and has offered unstructured data and is easier to deal with in Node than an SQL database. So I get all that ripped out and get Mongo working. Oh, but according to this podcast I listened to, I really should be writing this in a Kubernetes cluster or to be used in a serverless context on AWS. But wait, **what was I trying to accomplish in the first place?**

While learning all this new technology is great and I'm not advising people from not, I also know that there is a thing as "too much". Barry Schwartz calls this "The Paradox of Choice". When you have too much to choose from and learn or do, your senses get overloaded and you ask youself why you started to go down that route in the first place. I just needed a simple blog to get my ideas out to people, I didn't need to build one from scratch, I didn't need to learn 20 technologies to make it the best site in existence. I just needed to use a template and put it on Github pages and... well, you're reading this aren't you?

My point being after rambling for so long is that I have struggled to work or contribute to any projects outside of my work because I haven't felt a reason or drive to. I have been called a "Jack of All Trades", but most people leave off the next part of that phrase - "Master of None". As I said in my "About Me" section, this is my attempt to keep myself accountable to work on focusing my technologies down to what I need at the time. I don't need a microservices architecture with the latest and greatest full stack technologies and hot swapping all the time - I just need to start small with projects. I also need to find something that I can work on and *continue to work on past the first few weeks*. 

I guess you could call this an early New Year's resolution, but I am going to try to be better about working on a project and sticking to it. I have an idea for a project that I will be talking about later (when I get started on it and have something to show) that I think will be a good stepping stone for me.

*What are your thoughts? Have you struggled with working on personal projects or contributions? If so, what have you done to keep yourself motivated and working?*
