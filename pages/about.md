I am a fresh out of college programmer trying something new in order to learn more!

While my alias is "InTheKeyOfCSharp", I haven't worked on any C# or .NET projects in a long time. In fact, one of the main reasons for creating this blog is to keep myself motivated to work on my own projects or contribute to open source while documenting what I learn along the process in the hopes of helping someone else! As most say, teaching is the best way to learn, and I hope that by me attempting to help others in their journey that I will be able to help myself as well!

While the main purpose of this blog is for my programming journey, the blogs will not necessarily be only about programming. Depending on how I feel, I may throw in some blogs on self motivation, cooking, relationships, whatever I feel like blogging about! I will make sure to have tags associated with each blog so that you can filter out what you want and what you don't. 

This website is completely open source on [Github](https://github.com/InTheKeyOfCSharp/InTheKeyOfCSharp.github.io), so please open an issue or a pull request if you have any recommendations for the structure of my site!

If you have any suggestions for my content, please leave comments below the post or feel free to email me!
